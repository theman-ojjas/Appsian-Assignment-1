Project Name
Setup Instructions
Backend (C# .NET)

Navigate to the backend folder:

cd Backend

Restore .NET dependencies:

dotnet restore

Build the project:

dotnet build

Run the backend:

dotnet run
The backend should now be running on the configured port (usually https://localhost:5001 or http://localhost:5000).

Note: C# .NET projects typically don't use npm install for the backend. If you have any Node.js tooling or frontend assets in your backend folder, you may need npm install, but the standard approach is to use dotnet restore to restore NuGet packages.

Frontend (React)

Navigate to the frontend folder:

bash   cd frontend

Install dependencies:

bash   npm install

Start the frontend development server:

bash   npm start
The frontend should now be running on http://localhost:3000.
Quick Start
To run both backend and frontend together, you can use two terminal windows:
Terminal 1 (Backend):
bashcd Backend
dotnet restore
dotnet run
Terminal 2 (Frontend):
bashcd frontend
npm install
npm start
